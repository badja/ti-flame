Changes in Version 1.01
-----------------------
Version 1.01 fixes the problem that TI-83+ users had when sending
FLAME.8XP to their calculator.


This program displays an animated greyscale flame. The flame is
generated in real-time and flickers randomly.

Flame requires Ion to run. To run Flame, make sure Ion is installed on
your calculator. Send either FLAME.83P or FLAME.8XP (for the 83 and 83+
respectively) to your calculator and start Ion. Now you can run Flame.

You may use this routine in your own programs, as long as you give me
credit. Send any comments, ideas, or other feedback to badja@calc.org
